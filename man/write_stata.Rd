}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{data.frame} that should be saved as file.}

\description{
This function saves the content of a data frame to an STATA dta-file.
}
\note{
You don't need to take care whether variables have been imported with
        the \code{\link{read_stata}} function from this package or from \pkg{haven},
        or if you have imported STATA data and
        created new variables. This function does all necessary data preparation
        to write a properly labelled STATA file.
