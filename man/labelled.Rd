\title{Create a labelled vector}
\usage{
labelled(x, labels, is_na = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector to label. Must be either numeric or character.}

\item{labels}{Named vector. The vector should be the same type as
\code{x}. Unlike factors, labels don't need to be exhaustive: only a fraction
of the values might be labelled.}

\item{is_na}{Optionally, logical vector describing which levels should
be translated to missing values}
}
\description{
A labelled vector is a common data structure in other statistical
environments.
}
\note{
This method is derived from the \code{\link[haven]{labelled}} method
        of the \pkg{haven} package. \pkg{haven} up to version 0.2 \emph{does not}
        support the \code{is_na} attribute, however, the current
        \href{github.com/hadley/haven}{dev-version} does. Some of the
        \pkg{sjmisc} functions make use of this feature in advance, assuming
        that the \code{labelled} class supported by the \pkg{haven} package
        will be enhanced accordingly in a forthcoming update. Once the
        \pkg{haven} package is updated and introducing the new \code{labelled}
        class, this method might be removed.

\examples{
# labelled vector with multiple types of missing values
x <- labelled(c("M", "M", "F", "X", "N/A"),
              c(Male = "M", Female = "F", Refused = "X", "Not applicable" = "N/A"),
              c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))

x <- labelled(c(1, 2, 1, 5, 1, 5, 9),
              c(Male = 1, Female = 2, Refused = 5, Missing = 9),
              c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
