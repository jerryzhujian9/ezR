\title{Compute R-squared of (generalized) linear (mixed) models}
\usage{
r2(x, n = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Fitted model of class \code{lm}, \code{glm}, \code{lmerMod}/\code{lme}
or \code{glmerMod}.}

\item{n}{Optional, a \code{lmerMod} object, representing the fitted null-model
to \code{x} (unconditional model). If \code{n} is given, the pseudo-r-squared
for random intercept and random slope variances are computed (see Kwok et al. 2008;
see 'Examples' and 'Details').}
}
\value{
\itemize{
          \item For linear models, the r-squared and adjusted r-squared values.
          \item For linear mixed models, the r-squared and Omega-squared values.
          \item For \code{glm} objects, Cox & Snell's and Nagelkerke's pseudo r-squared values.
          \item For \code{glmerMod} objects, Tjur's coefficient of determination.

\description{
Compute R-squared values of linear (mixed) models, or
               pseudo-R-squared values for generalized linear (mixed) models.
}
\details{
If \code{n} is given, the Pseudo-R2 statistic is the proportion of
         explained variance in the random effect after adding co-variates or
         predictors to the model, or in short: the proportion of the explained
         variance in the random effect of the full (conditional) model \code{x}
         compared to the null (unconditional) model \code{n}.
}
\note{
For linear models, the r-squared and adjusted r-squared value is returned,
        as provided by the \code{summary}-function.
        \cr \cr
        For linear mixed models, an r-squared approximation by computing the
        correlation between the fitted and observed values, as suggested by
        Byrnes (2008), is returned as well as the Omega-squared value as
        suggested by Xu (2003), unless \code{n} is specified. If \code{n}
        is given, pseudo r-squared measures based on the variances of random
        intercept (tau 00, between-group-variance) and random slope (tau 11,
        random-slope-variance) are returned.
        \cr \cr
        For generalized linear models, Cox & Snell's and Nagelkerke's
        pseudo r-squared values are returned.
        \cr \cr
        For generalized linear mixed models, the coefficient of determination
        as suggested by Tjur (2009) (see also \code{\link{cod}}).
