\title{standard error of mean}
\usage{
ez.se(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector}
}
\value{
se = sd/sqrt(n). see https://www.statsdirect.com/help/basic_descriptive_statistics/standard_deviation.htm
\cr\cr For zscore (x-mean(x,na.rm=T))/sd(x,na.rm=T), or use \code{\link{ez.scale}}(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE) demean: ez.scale(x,center=TRUE,scale=FALSE). (ez.scale() auto omits NAs)
\cr z-scores indeed have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. Other than that, however, z-scores follow the exact same distribution as original scores. That is, standardizing scores doesn't make their distribution more or less "normal" in any way.

\description{
na will be omitted before calculation, the formula is sqrt(var(x,na.rm=TRUE)/length(na.omit(x))) (equivalent to sd(x,na.rm=TRUE)/sqrt(length(na.omit(x))))
