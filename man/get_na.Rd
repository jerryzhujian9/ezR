\title{Retrieve missing values of labelled variables}
\usage{
get_na(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Variable (vector) with value label attributes, including
missing value codes (see \code{\link{labelled}}).}
}
\value{
The missing values associated with value labels from \code{x},
          or \code{NULL} if \code{x} has no missing value attribute.
}
\description{
This function retrieves the value codes associated with missing values
               of variables of an imported SPSS, SAS or STATA data set (via \code{\link{read_spss}},
               \code{\link{read_sas}} or \code{\link{read_stata}}), where missing
               values have not been replaced with \code{NA}s after import,
               or of \code{\link[haven]{labelled}} vectors.
}
\details{
Other statistical software packages (like 'SPSS') allow to define
           multiple missing values, e.g. \emph{not applicable}, \emph{refused answer}
           or "real" missing. These missing types may be assigned with
           different values, so it is possible to distinguish between these
           missing types. In R, multiple declared missings cannot be represented
           in a similar way. However, \code{\link{labelled}} vectors
           allow to indicate different missings through the
           \code{is_na}-\code{\link{attr}}. Technically, these "missings" are
           stored as normal values. Thus, the \code{\link{table}} command,
           for instance, would include these values by default. The
           \pkg{sjmisc} package offers capabilities to deal with multiple
           declared missings and enhances the possibilities to work with
           labelled data, allowing for easy access of multiple declared
           missings or conversion into \code{NA} etc.

\examples{
# create labelled factor, with missing flag
x <- labelled(c("M", "M", "F", "X", "N/A"),
              c(Male = "M", Female = "F",
                Refused = "X", "Not applicable" = "N/A"),
              c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
get_na(x)

# create labelled integer, with missing flag
x <- labelled(c(1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1),
              c(Male = 1, Female = 2, Refused = 3, "N/A" = 4),
              c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
get_na(x)
